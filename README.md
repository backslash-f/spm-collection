My own Swift Packages collection, based on the following **WWDC21** session:

Whether you're curating packages for your team, for education purposes, or to share with other developers,
Swift Package Collections can help you discover, explore and import new packages into your project.

Discover improvements in the Swift Package workflow using Collections, and learn how you can curate, create,
sign, and share your own Swift Package Collections.
